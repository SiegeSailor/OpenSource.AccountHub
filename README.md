## Prerequisites

See `engines` in [package.json](./package.json):

```json
"engines": {
    "node": ">= 16.0.0",
    "npm": ">= 8.0.0"
},
```

MySQL [8.0.32 macOS-arm64](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=516827) is valid to use.

## Get Started

Use the following commands to help you to run or develop this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiegeSailor/OpenSource.AccountHub.git
```

Go to the folder you just created with `git clone`. It should be typically named `OpenSource.AccountHub`:

```bash
cd OpenSource.AccountHub
```

Install all the packages you need. Remember that you have to run this under `node >= 16.0.0` and `npm >= 8.0.0`. You can simply use `nvm use 16` if you have multiple versions on your local machine:

```bash
npm install
```

After installing packages, run the following command to start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Future Plan

Things will be completed after the first release:

- Dockerize with Monorepo Structure
- GitHub Actions CICD
- Deploy to AWS
- Connect to AWS Database
- Use AWS Cloud Logging
- Rewrite with TypeScript
- Session and Cookie
- XSS Prevention
- Unit Testing with Jest
- GitHub Issues Board
- Git Flow
